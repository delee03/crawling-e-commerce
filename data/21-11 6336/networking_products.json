      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever.

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Backward compatible with Cat 7, Cat 6a, Cat 6 and Cat 5e cables.     【Extremly Slim】Slim Cat8 short ethernet cable 1ft is half thinner than the regular Cat8 cable, making it the perfect solution for high density server rooms and data centers (switch to switch, switch to router, switch to server, switch to patch panel). It is also light, flexible and can be easily routed in small place with slim cat8 network cables.( unlike typical Cat8 cables that is difficult to run due to thick insulation).     【Dual Shielding】Cat 8 patch cable is made of double shielding F/FTP (overall foil and Individually foil shielding pairs), which protects from EMI/RFI line noise to avoid data loss or hardware damage and help equipment perform better. Cat 8 cables is especially suitable for high line noise environments.     【Fluke Test Pass】Cat8 ethernet cable is made of pure copper 30awg and pass Fluke DSX-8000 for project standard. Use patch cable cat 8 to upgrade network speed with confirdence for office network, residential network and home network project. Ethernet patch cables comply with ANSI/TIA 568.2-D standards.     【Upgrade and Clean Up Rack】Good size 1ft patch cable for clean wire management install. Short ethernet cable make your setup so much easier and cleaner with all same length and color. Cable patch cords is more reliable and secure than Cat6 cable network. Great for Tight Racks with very little space between the equipment. Meanwhile, CAT 8 rated cable are future forward compatible for future possible upgrade to 40G Speed.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Cat8 1ft ethernet cable is the ideal future proof and high performance solution for data, voice and audio/video signals with no lag. Backward compatible with Cat 7, Cat 6a, Cat 6 and Cat 5e cables.     【Extremly Slim】Slim Cat8 short ethernet cable 1ft is half thinner than the regular Cat8 cable, making it the perfect solution for high density server rooms and data centers (switch to switch, switch to router, switch to server, switch to patch panel). It is also light, flexible and can be easily routed in small place with slim cat8 network cables.( unlike typical Cat8 cables that is difficult to run due to thick insulation).     【Dual Shielding】Cat 8 patch cable is made of double shielding F/FTP (overall foil and Individually foil shielding pairs), which protects from EMI/RFI line noise to avoid data loss or hardware damage and help equipment perform better. Cat 8 cables is especially suitable for high line noise environments.     【Fluke Test Pass】Cat8 ethernet cable is made of pure copper 30awg and pass Fluke DSX-8000 for project standard. Use patch cable cat 8 to upgrade network speed with confirdence for office network, residential network and home network project. Ethernet patch cables comply with ANSI/TIA 568.2-D standards.     【Upgrade and Clean Up Rack】Good size 1ft patch cable for clean wire management install. Short ethernet cable make your setup so much easier and cleaner with all same length and color. Cable patch cords is more reliable and secure than Cat6 cable network. Great for Tight Racks with very little space between the equipment. Meanwhile, CAT 8 rated cable are future forward compatible for future possible upgrade to 40G Speed.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Cat8 1ft ethernet cable is the ideal future proof and high performance solution for data, voice and audio/video signals with no lag. Backward compatible with Cat 7, Cat 6a, Cat 6 and Cat 5e cables.     【Extremly Slim】Slim Cat8 short ethernet cable 1ft is half thinner than the regular Cat8 cable, making it the perfect solution for high density server rooms and data centers (switch to switch, switch to router, switch to server, switch to patch panel). It is also light, flexible and can be easily routed in small place with slim cat8 network cables.( unlike typical Cat8 cables that is difficult to run due to thick insulation).     【Dual Shielding】Cat 8 patch cable is made of double shielding F/FTP (overall foil and Individually foil shielding pairs), which protects from EMI/RFI line noise to avoid data loss or hardware damage and help equipment perform better. Cat 8 cables is especially suitable for high line noise environments.     【Fluke Test Pass】Cat8 ethernet cable is made of pure copper 30awg and pass Fluke DSX-8000 for project standard. Use patch cable cat 8 to upgrade network speed with confirdence for office network, residential network and home network project. Ethernet patch cables comply with ANSI/TIA 568.2-D standards.     【Upgrade and Clean Up Rack】Good size 1ft patch cable for clean wire management install. Short ethernet cable make your setup so much easier and cleaner with all same length and color. Cable patch cords is more reliable and secure than Cat6 cable network. Great for Tight Racks with very little space between the equipment. Meanwhile, CAT 8 rated cable are future forward compatible for future possible upgrade to 40G Speed.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",

      "description": "Easy Install: keystone based patch panels inserts with punchdown blocks jack and punch down on a keystone jack much more easily than in a 110 patch panel, especially for limited rack space.     Easy Repair: Keystones of cat 6 patch panel are punch down, just as an isolated unit, rather than 24 punch downs attached to the same frame. If you have trouble with a port, you can snap it out for inspection and then repair or replace it.     Flexibility for Future Remodel: Another flexibility benefit to going with keystone patch panel over a punch down 24 port patch panel cat6 is very easy to pop the keystones out of the panels and move them around for the inevitable remodel that maybe happen a few years after the wiring put in.     Mixable Connectivity: Cat6 patch panel with keystone make it a lot easier to insert other connectivity within same rackspace such as coax, fiber, HDMI, USB, whatever. You can also leave a few blank on panel that used as cable passthroughs.     Exquisite Details: Wall mount patch panel with punch down keystones come with a small punch tool in the package. Transparent keystone end caps secure cables in place and cable zip ties fasten ethernet cable onto back bar to less stress relief and avoid termination issues . Rj45 patch panel is equipped with gold plated keystone jacks which provide 10 Gigabit speed transmission performance. This modular patch panel meets or exceeds Cat6 specifications and can be instead of cat 5 panel.",
