With 32 unified AMD RDNA 3 compute units, it utilizes advanced AI and ray tracing accelerators for an immersive gaming experience.     Advanced Heat Dissipation: The meticulously engineered cooling system empowers overclocking for maximum graphics card performance. Dual Nitro FrostBlade ringed fans optimize airflow and pressure, efficiently dispersing GPU heat. The dual-ball bearing system, with lubricating oil, reduces noise, endures high temperatures, and minimizes friction and wear on fan bearings.     Optimal Cooling and Durability: The reinforced copper base efficiently absorbs heat from the GPU, swiftly dissipating it through oxygen-free heat pipes filled with ultra-pure water.

PCI Express uses a point to point serial connection, which does not require a request for bandwidth from the entire bus, and can increase the data transfer rate to a very high frequency, reaching a high bandwidth that PCI and AGP cannot provide.     40nm Process: The GT610 is a fully unified GPU graphics core that uses a 40nm process to dynamically allocate geometry, vertex physics effects or px shading operations to deliver excellent graphics processing power and gaming performance.     Operating Frequency: GT610 D3 graphics card core, memory frequency of 810MHz, 1000MHz, graphics card with 1.1ns high speed GDDR3 memory particles, memory specifications for 2GB 64bit.     Power Supply Design: The GT610 graphics card uses a PCB design with a 1 phase power supply design for the core part, equipped with a fully enclosed inductor and full solidly state capacitors to effectively defend the stability of the graphics card operation.     Output Interface:The interface is equipped with HD Multimedia Interface and DVI, VGA full interface design, can meet your needs.",

Temperature and Voltage Display – The newest risers card was built in a SMD temperature sensor which can probe the card temperature in real time, The default display is Temperature when power is on, press once to display Fahrenheit, press twice to display voltage. When the temperature is up to 75 degrees, the display will flash and alarm. This will bring convenience and safety when riser mining.     Powerful Power Supply: Double 6pin and one 4pin power interface makes the graphics card power supply independent from the motherboard, provide sufficient power supply to the motherboard when multiple graphics cards are connected. Gold-plated contact ensures perfect connectivity and extend service life.     Other Advantages: PCI-E 1X to 16X riser card Ver 014 Pro with 60cm USB3.0 cable, which is built-in multi-layer shielding nets to ensure the stable signal transmission within 3 meters. The graphics card slot is metal shielded to prevent interference and with a fastening buckle, which provide a firmly connect. The Pci-e 1X adapter card can be inserted into any PCI-E slot: 1x, 4x, 8x, 16x. Plug and Play, no driver installation required. Compatible with all WINDOWS systems, LINUX, MAC.",
