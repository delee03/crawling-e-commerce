No need to remove the backplate, easy installation of different CPU coolers directly on the AM5 platform armor, extremely convenient.     【Support Specifications】Product size: 45 (L) × 45 (W) × 0.6 (H) mm, Support 7950X, 7900X, 7700X, 7600X",

SPD Speed-2133MHz     Vengeance LPX is optimized for wide compatibility with the latest Intel and AMD DDR4 motherboards.     A low-profile height of just 34mm ensures that vengeance LPX even fits in most small-form-factor builds.     A high-performance PCB guarantees strong signal quality and stability for superior Overclocking ability.     A solid aluminum heatspreader efficiently dissipates heat from each module so that they consistently run at high clock speeds.     Supports Intel XMP 2.0 for simple one-setting installation and setup.     Available in multiple colors to match the style of your system. Package Memory Pin: 288",
