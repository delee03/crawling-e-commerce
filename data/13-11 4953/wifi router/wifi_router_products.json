      "description": "Ultra-fast WiFi speeds: With 802.11ax technology, NRadio wifi 6 router delivers WiFi speeds of up to 1.8 Gbps (1200 Mbps in the 5 GHz band and 574 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band), providing up to four times more network capacity and efficiency in traffic-intensive environments. As a result, this gigabit-class wireless router is ideal for streaming and online gaming.     Cutting-edge WiFi 6 technology extends network coverage: AX1800 wireless router uses WiFi 6's cutting-edge OFDMA technology to enable efficient data scheduling, allowing more transmissions to be sent at the same time and significantly improving network efficiency. Especially for multiplayer gaming scenarios, the reduced network latency is a significant improvement to the gaming experience.     WiFi coverage throughout the home. Built-in 4 high-gain antennas improve the router's receiving sensitivity and transmitting capability to maximize WiFi range; beam forming technology automatically detects cell phones, computers, smart homes and other end devices in the network, then focuses WiFi energy to the location of the terminal. Enhance signal, say goodbye to weak signal     Lower interference: N8 WiFi 6 Router supports BSS coloring technology, which marks information before it is transmitted. Wireless Internet data transmitted through our router at the same time may be identified and confirmed, thus effectively alleviating the problem of co-channel interference fallback in multiple routing scenarios and improving the communication efficiency of the entire network.     Easy setup. Offering 4 Gigabit wired ports, plug the cable into any of the router's network ports and start configuring Internet access in just a few simple steps. Smooth Internet speeds have never been so easy to obtain.",

That means it transmits at both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies at the same time. So no matter which band your wireless devices use, they'll automatically connect to the best available band for the fastest possible performance.     With three-stream 802.11ac technology, the Airport Extreme Base Station can reach data rates of up to 1.3Gbps, which is triple the 802.11n standard. 802.11ac Wi-Fi also provides double the channel bandwidth with 80MHz-wide channels providing more room for data to flow faster.     The redesigned Airport Extreme is now taller with antennas located at the top of the device and an increased number of antennas to six, three for 2.4GHz and three for 5GHz.     With AirPort Extreme, getting your new Wi?Fi network up and running is quick and easy. That's because a setup assistant is built into iOS and into AirPort Utility for OS X. As soon as you plug in your AirPort Extreme and connect it to your DSL or cable modem, you can follow the simple instructions on your Mac or iOS device. The setup assistant does all the work, so you don't have to.     The vertical design not only improves Wi?Fi performance, it also saves you valuable desk space. At less than 4 inches square, the footprint of AirPort Extreme is 64 percent smaller than its predecessor. And to save even more space, the power supply is built in.",

      "description": "Ultra-fast WiFi speeds: With 802.11ax technology, NRadio wifi 6 router delivers WiFi speeds of up to 1.8 Gbps (1200 Mbps in the 5 GHz band and 574 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band), providing up to four times more network capacity and efficiency in traffic-intensive environments. As a result, this gigabit-class wireless router is ideal for streaming and online gaming.     Cutting-edge WiFi 6 technology extends network coverage: AX1800 wireless router uses WiFi 6's cutting-edge OFDMA technology to enable efficient data scheduling, allowing more transmissions to be sent at the same time and significantly improving network efficiency. Especially for multiplayer gaming scenarios, the reduced network latency is a significant improvement to the gaming experience.     WiFi coverage throughout the home. Built-in 4 high-gain antennas improve the router's receiving sensitivity and transmitting capability to maximize WiFi range; beam forming technology automatically detects cell phones, computers, smart homes and other end devices in the network, then focuses WiFi energy to the location of the terminal. Enhance signal, say goodbye to weak signal     Lower interference: N8 WiFi 6 Router supports BSS coloring technology, which marks information before it is transmitted. Wireless Internet data transmitted through our router at the same time may be identified and confirmed, thus effectively alleviating the problem of co-channel interference fallback in multiple routing scenarios and improving the communication efficiency of the entire network.     Easy setup. Offering 4 Gigabit wired ports, plug the cable into any of the router's network ports and start configuring Internet access in just a few simple steps. Smooth Internet speeds have never been so easy to obtain.",
