AccuVoice technology works the same way as hearing aid technology but with a much more sophisticated processor capable of subtle sound manipulation.     SIX LEVELS OF VOICE BOOST: The SB380 Soundbar uses our patented hearing aid technology to provide six levels of voice enhancement. Each new level emphasizes the dialogue while minimizing the non-vocal elements of the soundtrack. Even at extremely low volumes, voices are clear and easy to understand.     WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE:The SB380's sleek 3.3\" aluminum cabinet houses high-performance speakers, a digital amplifier, a ZVOX PhaseCue virtual surround system, and a built-in powered subwoofer for excellent bass, along with all necessary cables and accessories you will need, like an optic cable, an analog connecting cable, a remote control, and a quick start guide.     SUPER EASY SET UP: Our SB380 Soundbar is compatible with almost all television brands and models as long as your television has an audio output. You can wall mount it, place it in front of the TV, or place it on a shelf. It functions without the use of wi-fi, phone apps, or pairing. Simply connect the speaker to your TV, go to the TV's on-screen settings and select the external speaker sound option.",
