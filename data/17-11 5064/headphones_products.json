With the EQ settings in the Sony Headphones Connect app, you can even adjust the sound to your own taste and create an individual listening experience.     Take calls with a click of the buttons on the ear cups without having to take your phone out of the case. Thanks to the high-quality built-in microphone and noise cancelling, the WH-CH520 records the sound and reduces ambient noise during the conversation, so you can have clear conversations even in noisy environments.     With the adjustable headband, soft ear pads and lightweight design, you can find the perfect fit for you, so that the on-ear headphones stay comfortable for longer.",
